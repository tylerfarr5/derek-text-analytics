took on bedford and central was able to
take that one at home by a score of
41-27

right here at the state playoffs but on
a drive that could have given them the
lead they fumbled the ball right where
i'm standing at the 10-yard line
[Applause]

northwestern able to come up with
possession steigletter pass this one
inside could it be another it is
northwestern slots that one in the back
of the net
and it looks like it's josie
on that one able to find her way past
the penn state defensive line they were
just playing too high and alacino the
leading goal scorer for northwestern to
make all the space herself right footed
shot wood saves it and the deflection is
in
wood pushes it out to carry a bellow and
she cleans it up on the back post two to
one now in favor of north western
there's some life for the nittany lions
here this one into wasserman
but that will end it
the last chance was definitely exciting
but penn state not able to slot it past
bayley kalinski who will end the game
with three saves your final score from

it'll be penn state on offense now
resuming from first and ten on their
opponent's 42-yard line clifford takes a
snap looks out to the left and has john
dodson dodson breaks one tackle breaks
another one's ankles and pushes it past
the first down marker and is able to get
a gain of about 12 on that one
is this thing on wow okay um that should
have gone for probably about three yards
and he made it into 12.
chris johnson made about
chris ogerman is the main one who had
his ankles broken out to the left side
on that one
clifford now back in the shotgun
has two receivers out to his left and a
tight end another wide receiver out to
his right clifford takes the snap hands
it off to noah kane noah kane out to the
left and will gain about five before
he's brought down
by a couple of ball state defenders
cole pierce has been on a lot of tackles
looked like um
amechi uzodinma also in on the tackle
penn state same formation noah kane out
to clifford's right clifford
now motions parker washington behind him
clifford takes the snap
handoff to noah kane around the left
side he has a gap outside past the
20-yard line and pushes forward past the
first down marker and is tackled by jack
sate on the near sideline another first
down for the nittany lions moving into
the red zone yet again in this game penn
state three for three in the red zone
unlike ball state who's been oh and
two clifford now operating from the
16 yard line barking out orders two wide
receivers to his right one to the left
noah kane to the left of clifford
clifford now looking to the sideline for
guidance
changing up the play
clifford waiting in the shotgun
one clap takes the snap
and up to noah kane noah kane looks for
a gap in the line and is not able to
find one gains about two
for a couple of defensive linemen for
ball state are able to break them down
looks like
justin ramsey in on the tackle for ball
state
[Music]
as penn state playing slow reluctant to
stray a little bit away from
the fast-paced game that they have been
playing
clifford now motions a tight end across
the line
clifford
awaiting the snap in the shotgun hands
the ball off to noah kane around to the
right side able to break through and
gets tackled
after a gain of about two and that'll
bring up third down cole pierce in on
the tackle
and jimmy daw in there as well two of
the really experienced guys
pierce no tackles up to this
point as clifford
and the penn state offense resumed from
the 11 clifford takes the snap looks out
to the right side doesn't see anyone
instead tucking and running clifford
around the left side has a bunch of
receipt bunch of defenders in front of
him dives for the first down marker and
it's gonna be close
oh
that's gonna be really close
and they're gonna give it to him no need
for the chain gang first down for the
nittany lions from the six
penn state operating in the red zone
they have only gotten touchdowns so far
here
[Music]
clifford in the shotgun the running back
to his left is noah kane two wide
receivers to his right and two tight
ends to his left
clifford waiting for the umpire to move
now sits behind his center takes the
snap hands off to noah kane up the
middle kane able to stiff arm and look
for the corner and he's gonna get pushed
back and out of bounds
by brett anderson the safety able to
come all the way in and make that tackle
looks like a gain of about one on that
one second and goal now for the nittany
lions
looking to push their lead
to a vast 34 points
and bryce cosby got bryce cosby got his
nose in there as well helping out his uh
his teammate over there to stand up noah
kane clifford empty backfield three wide
receivers to his right two to his left
second and goal clifford motions parker
washington a little bit on the left
still there clifford takes the snap
looks out to the right pressured by a
ton of ball state people and he will
instead just lob this one out past
the end zone
and incomplete
third down and goal from the penn state
four good decision again by clifford
flushed out of the pocket not a whole
lot going on just throw it out of the
back of the end zone so you don't make a
critical mistake
john clifford now trying to cap off this
red zone trip
with a game ceiling touchdown 34-6 your
score 10 49 to go in the game
clifford back in shotgun noah kane to
his right
deandre lambert smith and parker
washington do his left smit
washington now in motion as clifford
takes the snap hands off to noah kane
and kane is tripped up in the backfield
and loses about a yard
looks like that was brett anderson
making yet another tackle for ball state
he stood tall on this red zone defense
that'll bring on
the special teams unit for the nittany
lions not able to capitalize with
another touchdown in the second half
as that will bring on the swiss army
knife for the special teams jordan stout
for the kick
it is a short 23-yard kick
stout old looks good kick is up
and right through the uprights 37-6 now
the lead penn state up 31 on unranked
ball state into home opener as fans are
starting to head toward the exit they
think this one's all but done but don't
you go anywhere there's still 10 minutes
of game time right here on com radio

from jeffrey field for the penn state
versus michigan
semi-final in the big ten tournament for
men's soccer
penn state currently on top two to one
derek hyde alongside andrew field for
your second
following to throw in penn state back in
the ball in the defense
brandon hackenberg trying to boot the
ball down the near
dominar sideline can't get anything as
repo likes to reset
and gives the ball back to chris shakes
chris shakes pass
passing the deep ball down the right
field line into
pierre reedy and that ball go over the
head of reedy
and michigan will dispossess and take
ball
from midfield michigan looking a little
bit threatening pithers had some space
in the outside but
penn state able to make a big defensive
play in the middle resetting now is
hackenberg hackenberg looking for the
speedy tiger evans on the near side
evans able to get the ball he's got his
man on the ground slide tackle from
behind
and tiger ends up on his ground on the
ground and there's no call there either
michigan backing the ball with the
defense
pithers on the ball in the near side for
the wolverines pithers passes the ball
into rogers
rogers into telus tell us back to
pithers on the near side
about 30 yards off from the goal pithers
looking for a crossing opportunity
likes to pull the ball back and in the
middle finds rogers
rogers on his right foot passing it back
over to
carlos tellez on the right side
rolling the ball nice and slow outside
the box not
making attempt in yet quick through ball
in attempt for
from the midfield there for michigan
gets easily taken away from penn state
and taken out for a throw-in
michigan on the throw-in looks like
it'll be austin swipes to take it
certainly taking his time as
all the players backing up deep inside
the gold box
as switch has a little bit of an arm
switch takes the throw in deep throwing
ball
can they get a head on it michigan does
not
looking for an attempt shot attempt by
brush blocked in front of the net
michigan attacking down the left down
the left line past attempt back to
yabara shot
popped up in the air and as chris shakes
tries to get under it he gets fouled
from behind
and this will be a a free kick now as
chris shakes is not
happy that that contact had even
happened to begin with chris schatz
looking for a yellow card
yeah and that was tough contact there
too and normally shakes
a bigger guy and especially being a
goaltender being
taken down that play you know that that
was a clear and obvious foul on the play
there and i think that
that kind of goes without being said but
you know michigan
has pretty much controlled possession in
penn state's
uh attacking third or penn state's half
uh throughout so far in the first uh
six minutes and change so i think that
you know penn state wants to able
to kind of get out of their own zone
they have to be crisper with their
passes
had a couple kind of go wide and go long
and kind of maintaining possession i
mentioned that at the beginning
penn state not really able to keep the
ball michigan's been the one with
the opportunity so far in this half and
that's a reason why whatever keeps the
clock ticking is definitely the recipe
for penn state at the moment
as that goal kick ends up in defeat of
michigan
kevin bucca the left midfielder on the
ball now attacking down the far
side likes to dump it off to his left
back
looked like osmond osmond back to buca
buca trying to make a move inside
and that'll get kicked out of bounds by
the right back for
penn state that'll be femi omodesu odesu
and you mentioned something earlier
derek kind of the clock ticking but
you know if you're penn state you have a
2-1 lead you don't want to turtle up
here you don't want to kind of sit in
your own
half and that's a recipe for disaster
you got to be somewhat aggressive
here and you gotta look for something
you can't just sit in your own zone and
expect to win this game
abara taking the corner kick for
michigan trying to get a head on it
over the head it's in the feet of switch
as swift tries to cut back
that'll be taken off of privet and out
for another corner on the other side
abarra will take that one as well as he
runs over
to go and cover that corner kick and
michigan has had success off of these
set pieces derek obviously in the first
half was swoyed scoring off
that corner and you know penn state's
just got to mark up here they got to
have man on man here and see if they're
able to convert
labara's corner comes in low line drive
and hackenberg able to easily get a foot
on and clear it down the near sidelines
looking for below you but not able to
connect that that pass
as a couple of bounces and the ball ends
up at liam butt's feet in the middle of
the field
but able to find tiger evans who has an
open blow you
daniel blow you one on one with the
goalkeeper decides to cut it back on his
left foot he crosses it and that shot
goes wide
pierre reedy trying to get a foot on it
on the touch line but that's cleared out
by michigan and out for a penn state
throw in great attempt for penn state
not able to get it behind the goalkeeper
penn state's still threatening off the
throw-in able to wheel and deal inside
as odesu
odesu's cross is blocked bouncing ball
into bots butts takes a shot and that's
blocked in front of the net too
michigan trying to clear their lines a
heading attempt by penn state and that
goes out of bounds for a michigan
throw-in
lots of series of events and nothing
behind the goalkeepers
of michigan that was a lot of action
there derek first
starting off with blow you there decided
to cut it on the outside to his left
foot
it'd be interesting i would have liked
to see if maybe he could cut it in with
his stronger side his right foot
but he had a defender there on him so
that was probably the right move by him
to cut it
out to the outside of the left side of
the goal but then how about that other
opportunity from butts he had a one-time
shot off that
high arcing ball and a nice block there
by the michigan defense there are two
chances for penn state
nothing on goal but that's what you want
to see more of in this half especially
penn state offense on the ball into
tiger evans evans can take a shot
left footed shot attempt he's fouled a
clearance attempt on the line it's
saved what a great save by the michigan
defense it was behind the goalkeeper
in a sliding challenge there by jens
hoff i believe
that was another military institute 42
41
16 minutes to go in the second half
still plenty of time to make a comeback
though
as penn state still or shooting so far
35
from field goal range from the field
goals on so far
in this game not too great vmi 50 though
as we're getting ready to reset miles
dredd inbounds the ball to sam sessoms
as it looks like vmi trying to trap him
on the half court now not too difficult
though as
miles dredd pass it over to sessom
back over to wheeler at the top of the
key over to brockington also all of this
outside three-point range
wheeler wide open three he shoots it and
it drops for him penn state
up 44-42 now 15 40 to go in the second
half yeah the vmi defense just
completely backed off there wheeler just
took one step back it was wide open on
the elbow and just said i'm pulling the
trigger
splashes the three derrick hide chris
hess on the broadcast today
wide open shot for vmi it's curfman and
he drops it
trading three-pointers now his bmi in

one
miles dredd taking it up half court now
over to sessoms
sessoms back to brockington over to
wheeler
trying to get hot looking for another
one over to sessoms
in the near side corner sessoms open
pulls a three
and that goes off the back iron wheeler
kicks out to a wide open miles dread
and it's in and out penn state still
down one looking for another basket
yeah that ball was probably about 60
percent down and then just hit back
backboard spun out again and came out
always the biggest heartbreakers curfman
driving in now his shot gets blocked by
buttrick
on the rebound stevens that won't fall
either buttrick now
on the rebound for penn state pass it up
the wheeler
wheeler trying to make space for himself
he drives in left-handed layup that
doesn't go
rebound brockington and he gets fouled
brockton with a strong
power move there one of the stronger
guys on this penn state team and one of
the also one of the most elusive that
you know when he flashes into the paint
good luck trying to stop him rockington
making a real impact on the paint so far
in this game
seven rebounds so far and seven points
four of those being inside the paint
point
rockington now on the line for penn
state trying to tie it here
takes a couple of dribbles and throws up
the free throw and that'll drop for him
45 45
14 33 to go in the second half
another shot coming up for brockington
this one to give penn state the lead
a couple of substitutions for vmi as
well as lewis will
exit the game and conway will re-enter
rockington's free throw is up
and that'll sink as well 46-45 in favor
of the nittany lions yet another lead
change
in this game
bmi now taking the ball up at stevens
stevens off to kerfman
hurfman at the top of the key miles
dread playing close defense on him
really far away from the three-point
line
earth been looking for a pass he's got
stevens inside stevens trying to post up
seth lundy on the mismatch
and he throws up a layup and that won't
go rebound wheeler
wheeler up to sessions trying to catch
him quick sessoms inside the paint
left-handed layup won't fall either
vmi gets a rebound and they just turn it
right over
wheeler pulls one up from three and
that'll fall
penn state goes up 49-45 on the
three-pointer from jamari wheeler

chris hess
as we're getting ready to resume play
here live from inside the bryce jordan
center
we're all having a good time here in
state college live during the
thanksgiving break
as we're getting ready to resume
basketball right here as it goes into
greg parham the point guard
bringing it up for vmi he's guarded
closely by wheeler
harum passes over to tang who re-enters
the game
over to curfeman curfeman into the
center stevens stevens against dredd a
little bit of a mismatch back over to
parham
arum looking for a screen from stevens
as he shifts over to the right side
paramount parham into the paint and he
gets blocked by miles dredd
dredd now looking to reset quickly wide
open wheeler he
pulls up and it's off the mark
follow go out of bounds and into vmi's
territory
13 minutes to go in this second half vmi
trying to get back on the board scoring
drop for them over the past two and a
half
kerfman now bringing the ball up he's
guarded by brockington herfman into
stevens
stevens over to parham who pulls up a
corner three and that won't go either
sam sessoms gets a steal fast break
opportunity euros step up with the right
and that'll drop
53-45 in favor of the nittany lions now
yeah sessom's doing a really good job
he's making it his game he's dictating
the speed of this game too he can slow
you down
he can play fast he does it all bmi now
trying to
come back they're letting the game slip
out of their hands curffman into stevens
there'll be a foul call on the floor
looks like it's going to be against
miles dredd
for a shove off ball shot clock resets
to 20.
inbound from bonham goes into stevens
stevens at the top of the key now off to
curfeman
herfman at the top passed it over to
bonham bought him inside to stevens
again he's working against sessoms
pass it outside to conway conway drives
he's looking for a wide open one it's
karfman kerfman
up and down vmi scores a three-pointer
to bring him back within five 53-48 the
score
penn state trying to attack quickly and
buttrick pulls up from three-point range
and that's not even close off the front
iron and down
not a great shot as the rebound will be
taken by stevens and a timeout will
follow
on the floor and it looks like we'll
take one with them
penn state you're listening to penn
state men's basketball right here on com
radio
you should be able to hit them all the
time as the kickoff is fieldable this
time for lamont wade as lamont wade
brushes down the right side of the field
he breaks a couple tackles he's down to
30. 35-40
and pushed out of bounds making good
field position for the nittany lions
lamont wade making sure to strut his
stuff afterwards first and ten coming up
from what looks like their own 39-yard
line
that's the only only the second kick
return this season for lamont wade he
had one
at indiana in the first game of the year
and it was a five yard run
that one much better as he caught it at
about the goal line and was able to
bring it out to about the 38 yard line
really good run there from wade
the senior getting the start today as
the kick returner and it gives good
starting field position to the nittany
lions i think lamont wade's trying to
make a case for himself to
continue to use for the rest of the
season as sean clifford back in shotgun
he's got devon ford out to his left
clifford takes the snap
rushes up the middle doesn't really get
anywhere and he's dropped by a couple of
michigan state defensive linemen for a
gain of nothing second and ten upcoming
yeah and again the michigan state
defense has done a really good job as
this game has progressed
even better and better of not allowing
big plays on the ground and
i keep saying this but you know penn
state likes to run 68 percent of their
plays over the last two weeks have been
running plays and the fact that right
now penn state can't get anything on the
ground is really helping michigan
state's defense clifford takes the snap
looks out to the left it's johan dotson
in the flat dodson rushing for the pylon
and he's able to get down there
past the past the yardage marker for a
first down ball on the 50-yard line
first down upcoming for the blue and
white
and and the air has been the better area
so far
for penn state that's where they've
racked up most of their yards that's
where clifford has looked better so far
and dotson there with his first touch of
the day is able to move the sticks
definitely a little bit different than
what the nittany lions are used to
hence the deficit on the scoreboard
clifford back and shotgun he's got devon
ford to his right
three wide receivers to the right of
clifford clifford takes the snap hands
it up to devin ford up the middle
devin ford plows through one player and
gets up for about a gain of five before
he's dropped
by a gang of michigan state players
looking like naquan
jones will be getting the credit for the
spartans and that was ford's first carry
of the day
able to get five yards on it and set up
second and five
looks like that was actually kaziah
holmes the true freshman in there
instead of devin ford haven't
seen much of devon ford even though he
is the starter on the depth chart
sean clifford now back in shotgun palms
off to his right
clifford takes the snap delayed hand off
up to kaziah holmes who's gonna
burst through for a couple of yards and
get tackled by another gang of michigan
state defenders
and that'll be a gain of two third down
and two or three upcoming
for penn state and you can bet will
levis is probably going to come back
into the game
and the question is will he run or throw
franklin has tried to or
said this past week he wants to get
levis throwing the ball more
but they always bring him down on these
third down plays this is his third time
in today
so far he's been able to move the sticks
on his first two the third down
quarterback will levis
now standing in shotgun a couple of
tight ends out there for him as well
will levis three wide receivers to his
right
puts a man in motion levis takes the
snap waits for things to be set up in
front of him and he plows through gets a
couple of blocks and he's going to get
past the first down marker
will levis converting yet another third
down for penn state
yeah three for three i mean if it's
working why stop it and so levis
gets it there moves the sticks and this
penn state offense able to keep driving
down the field as sean clifford will
come back into the game now
first and ten for the nittany lions as
they are now inside of michigan state
territory
looks like ball is around the 40-yard
line
in field goal range now for penn state
but they want more
ball on the 37 to be exact clifford and
shotgun three wide receivers to his
right
true freshman running back kaziah holmes
on his left and jahan dots in the lone
man
on the far left clifford takes the snap
looks out to the right doesn't see
anyone looks for datsun down the left
side of the field dotson comes back and
he hauls it in
no he hits the ground and it gets broken
up and dropped
could have been a massive gain for the
nittany lions
it sure could have been dotson had it
nearly
but really nice coverage by kaylaon
girvin to knock it out as datsun was
falling to the ground
he never had complete control of it and
as he hit the ground
i think girvin's arm getting in plus
just dotson coming down
hard brought the ball out and it's going
to set up second and 10.
second and ten for the nittany lions
ball on the 37. sean clifford back in
shotgun
same formation as last time except
holmes is on the right
and now he is actually motioned over to
the left same exact formation as the
last play three wide receivers on the
right clifford takes the snap looks out
to the right
passes out to bretton strange in the
middle of the field who gets brought
down
just about immediately by the linebacker
kaylaon girvin and again friarmuth
this is the third straight game that
thor without him he had season ending
surgery
from an injury in the ohio state game
and the backup tight ends
what were backups now are the starters
in both theo johnson
and brenton strange have been very good
so far
in his absence and able to pick up six
yards on that play
penn state pretty good at recruiting
tight ends shotgun now
double tight ends to the left now for
the nittany lion sean clifford back in
shotgun kazai homes to his right
clifford takes the snap up the middle of
the field and he breaks through the line
he's no one past him clifford walks in
untouched for a nittany lion touchdown
putting him up
9-7 31-yard rushing touchdown for the
quarterback clifford
sean clifford doing his best will levis
impression not even looking to pass the
ball and just run it right up the middle
and this one will go for six penn state
back on top
as jake pinnacle comes out for the extra
point and pinnager will put it right
through the pipes 10-7 now the score
in favor of penn state in the battle of
the land grant universities

welcome back to Spartan Stadium 13
nothing is the score in favor of Penn
State it's lower key on the right hash
he's got right on his left he motions
Dotson over to the left side and he
hands it back off the right up the
middle and he's getting stuffed by about
six different Penn State defenders and
he's not going to get much of anything
they're gonna give him a yard out of
pity I believe that was Fred Hansard who
just burst through the line the backup D
tackle getting right up there in the a
block and making tackle also had Trent
Gordon coming off the edge the
cornerback it's lower key working the
offense third and six now 10:30 to go in
the second quarter as lower keys looking
cold himself hands in the hand warmers
he's got trips on his right no back with
him two wide receivers to his left third
and six waiting the furthest snap in the
middle of field the work he takes it
looks out to his right he finds his guy
it's Stewart jr. over the middle who
will get the first down before he's
tackled by j-kwon brisker in the middle
of the field
good open field tackle that's right and
now you're talking this is the play that
beats Penn State a lot they love to run
the zone with the second area it's the
short slants and quick throws over the
middle that has been moving the chains
on this Drive saw it a lot the
Wolverines Josh Gattis did a lot last
week lower key opting to go at the penn
state route no huddle as he's in the
pistol again it's time it's Elijah
Collins behind him and he's gonna hand
it off to Louisa Collins who's trying to
break it out around the left tackle and
he's gonna get stopped for a gain of
nothing him at the left half it's micah
parsons making the tackle for the
Nittany Lions Parsons coming up a little
gingerly as well see if he stays on the
field
it looks like he's holding his hip kind
of flexing out his right leg he's such a
key part of this Penn State defense
leads the team in tackles he's gonna
stay on get it tough it out could just
be a cramp from the cold or a charley
horse lower key back in the shotgun
three wide receivers to his right he's
going to look that way throws a screen
pass out to Loras Nelson and he's gonna
break one tackle and get tackled by the
neck school
incoming and it's actually eater gross
Matos coming out from
he lied a scrimmage haven't called his
name out a lot he draws a lot of
attention on the offensive line right
there they faked the screen to the other
side and gross mono is coming way off
the line Gordon was there alongside him
to make that tackle impressive play by
eater gross mottos covering the entire
length of the field I'm sure these
Scouts and attendants would love to see
that once right
it's lower key back on the right hash
8:39 to go in the second quarter lower
key takes the snap looking to his left
can't find anyone about the taken
himself and he just checks one deep and
there's gonna be pass interference
called two flags incoming he was looking
for Durrell Stewart jr. and he's getting
covered by two different Nittany Lions
including j-kwon brisker yes this is
gonna be on Trent Gordon he was running
step first step with Stewart they're
also getting some words of advice from
the senior Garrett Taylor bud just I
believe probably yanking on that jersey
behind him trying to not allow Stewart
to get enough space to turn the corner
and take it to the end zone still
awaiting for the official call as it
sounds like you were correct Trent
Gordon will get called for pass
interference that'll move the chains for
the Spartans the work he's gonna like to
see that one as they are now into Penn
State territory for the first time since
Jordan stout hooked that kick off out of
bounds and started the Spartans at the
35 yard line
Spartans really need six on this Drive
down by 13 this is the first promising
that drive that they've had in quite a
while and now getting the benefit of a
couple of penalties on this defense
lower key in the middle of the field
they've got a tight set up this Spartans
do an extra lineman and staggered
receivers very close to the line most
likely going to be a run to Collins
lorikeet takes the snap hands it off to
Collins up the middle he's gonna break a
tackle busts it out wide around the
tackle and he's going to get a gain of
eight fans get into it as he could have
broken that one but he gets tackled by
the safety Taylor
cam Brown also there coming from the
linebackers he's also a very valuable
part of this defense but what a run from
Collins are just kept bouncing off of
his offensive lineman more to the
outside it's now lower key working on
the left hash second and four 756 to go
in the second quarter lower key opting
to put Elijah Collins on his left
instead of behind him he's got two
staggered receivers on his left two more
out wide on the right he's gonna he's
going to fake a pass and can't it up to
Collins up the middle Penn State didn't
take anything with that one and it's
going to be Penn State crushing them up
the middle looks like Jesse and Luke or
no that was Robby two-wire I believe who
got in very sprung don't see him a ton
on defense just coming in for a one play
cam Brown also in on the tackle there
for Penn State
Brian lower key on the left hash looking
towards the sideline seems a bit
confused by the play call as they're
still waiting
both teams do have all three of their
timeouts no one's used one yet seven
minutes to go in the second quarter
lower key back to work he's moving
Dotson to his right side and he's taking
the snap looking out to his left he's
gonna check one deep and that pass is
covered by Lamont Wade but oh my
goodness does that receiver make a good
catch let's see what the calls gonna be
still wanna catch my sowards if they
call it oh no incomplete late let's see
if he kept his feet inbounds excellent
coverage from Lamont Wade oh I think
they might want to take a look at this
Derrick brandon sowards looking for his
first reception of the year on that one
is able to pull it down my question is
is he out of bound I think he had it
looked like he got a foot in and then
fell backwards I don't know they'll see
if they look at this referees electing
to not take a look at it themself Mark
Dantonio the head coach for the Spartans
not throwing out the red flag lower key
on the left hash is doing it himself big
fourth down here keeping the offense on
the field Orakei takes the snap he looks
out out to his left he's able to get
Kobi white then he is able to get in
front of the chains in
another Spartan first down Cody white an
impressive catch over the middle
another underneath slant route to Cody
white who has now brought in both of his
targets so far today the work he now
look into the sidelines after moving the
chains 6:30 to go here in the second
quarter first in 10 Spartans have the
ball at the Penn State 28 yard line
their best field position of the game
yet a little bit of good karma for
Michigan State getting the first down on
that fourth down conversion after that
controversial non catch lower key on the
left hash he takes it and he hands it
off to Collins out around the tackle to
the left he's able to run through a hole
and get a gain of about three before
he's tackled but I believe Jann Johnson
two yards on the play second and eight
ensuing six minutes to go here in the
second quarter and stayed up 13 to
nothing not much has happened since Jake
pin agura missed that extra point for
the Nittany Lions seems like the type of
play that would be very big in a game
between Michigan State and Penn State
it's always come down to the wire lower
key on the left hash and he's given it
to Collins no he pulls it back and he
Chuck's one deep towards the end zone
he's looking first steward and that Kant
swatted and there's a flag on the play
j-kwon Briscoe the one making the play
is quite upset we're gonna wait for the
official call could it be pass
interference
Jaquan brisker and who else jot they
have a linebacker dropped that far that
was Jan Johnson was playing more of a
safety role who was back in the end zone
they might call this on Jan Johnson but
a fan
Oh Jo Johnson late a massive hit on
Stuart after the play brilli is gonna be
ashamed of Jaquan brisker made an
outstanding play coming over from the
cornerback position Oh Jan Johnson just
laid up big hit this could be targeting
that's probably what they're looking at
here the referees are in a circle right
around the big 10 logo targeting j-kwon
brisker had an incredible coverage as
you said able to swat that ball before
it's able to get to Daryl Stewart jr.
and Jan Johnson could be hit for
targeting the Spartan fans booing so I
think they there's offsetting penalties
photos there was holding on the offense
there they're gonna get I believe that
is coming Matt
holding and now they're gonna review Jan
Johnson for targeting coming out of that
linebacker position where he's dropping
back and guarding Stewart out of the
slot and then Johnson coming over and
kind of I think this is this might be
textbook definition of targeting it's
not obvious but coming in with the top
of his helmet and hitting do Stewart
right in the face mask oh yeah I know I
see a little bit of arms there and our
top wide receiver for the year maybe a
little bit of a surprise but both Derek
and I decided on Rashad Ross as being
our number one wide receiver people
might be up in arms about this Charles
Johnson did have the better stats in
terms of yardage but our argument was
Charles Johnson had Jalen Marshall on
the other side of him so the other
team's corners couldn't focus purely on
him but Rashad Ross was pretty much all
that the hotshots passing game had and
it turned out he was really all that
they needed yeah the big thing that I
want to look at is basically we talked
about how injuries kind of affected
teams and Rashad Ross I was the one who
kind of convinced you to bring Rashad
Ross into the top wide receiver
consideration because he was the one
getting double-teamed for Arizona
constantly Charles Johnson if you look
at pure yardage from wide receivers
there are four Orlando wide receivers
before you get to number two on Arizona
and that would be Richard Mulaney
obviously they had an injury to Josh
Huff earlier in the season the hotshots
which kind of hurt their stats there but
Rashad Ross was a beast week in and week
out and despite the injuries that he was
plagued with he was still catching five
or six balls a game even though it hurt
him that badly he's just a beast and I
had to give the award to him whether or
not you agreed I agree no I totally I do
agree he had that performance where he
was injured he got up after every single
catch and made vital plays for the
hotshots to give them the win so I think
in terms of heart for the game and
everything Rashad Ross takes the cake
for wide receivers now we have running
backs this one was a little harder I
think no um no you don't think it was
harder I think was harder just purely in
terms of efficiency as a runner though I
guess Trent Richardson was much more
efficient than the guy I had in second
place
but yes our top running back for the
year was Trent Richardson this one
should be pretty obvious considering the
massive number of touchdowns he had and
he definitely picked up his ability to
be more of just a touchdown more than
just a touchdown machine and actually
move the ball as the league closed out
but yes we have Trent Richardson wit
being the top running back for the year
yeah I don't understand how you could
have thought that was close to yarnís
Johnson only had six more rushing yards
than Trent Richardson Johnson obviously
had a lot less carries because he wasn't
the undeniable starter for Orlando
throughout the whole season but Trent
Richardson had 11 touchdowns put that
into perspective there were eight games
in the season and number two on this
list had six and that would be Joelle
blonde yo and just I think those are
some incredible stats that you have to
give respect to then Trent Richardson
wins it just out of the pure bulk of
carries he got yeah the only reason I
had the Ernest Johnson in the
conversation is because he averaged a
whopping five point eight yards per
carry on the season which is a lot so in
terms of touchdowns yes he wasn't that
great in terms of yards he was only
ahead of Richardson by a few but his
yards per carry were just massive that
you could also probably attribute that
to just the offense that he was playing
in if you give him more carries I feel
like he could have put up the numbers
that would have convinced me but it just
didn't go that way and unfortunately for
him I'm gonna have to go with Richardson
by a landslide all right well a
quarterback where there should be really
no debate
for who the top quarterback is and that
is Garrett Gilbert
sleeping on Johnny Manziel I see yes I'm
sleeping hard on Johnny Manziel yeah
there's just no debate here it's gotta
be Garrett Gilbert and number two
personally would have to be John Wolford
at my eyes even though he had that slump
in the middle of the season it just had
to go with Gilbert Gilbert had the most
completions in the Alliance he had an
over 60 percent completion rating he was
the only quarterback to throw for over
2,000 yards had 13 touchdowns he only
threw three picks and I believe there
wasn't a single game in the Alliance but
he threw for less than 200 yards and
that is a feat in itself and he's got to
give he's got to get that award in my
eyes
out of ten they'll tell you Derek to
just like it's been back and forth back
of are not Mary sustained possessions in
this period as well son that's been a
familiar seaman it's still really cold
in here to the two tens at center ice
its Vasco and Welch Mercyhurst wins the
faceoff with Vasco Penn State trying to
attack down the near boards this time
and they get pinched off not even
getting it through the blue line
Mercyhurst will keep it and dump it back
to the Penn State defense it's Ganga
Rosa Ganga Rosa tries to go
point-to-point bad pass Mercyhurst is on
the puck now it's Nellis Nellis cross
ice to Newton and Newton and takes a
shot it's in the back of the net
Mercyhurst goes up to nothing on a slap
shot by the finnish national prospect
Emma Newton meds oh my goodness what a
rip from the left side in the nursery
Hearst owned that thing had eyes it was
rising you heard his far too was far de
what a shot by Newton him oh my goodness
it all goes back to the bad pass by
renege angerosa trying to go
point-to-point to hemming her she just
doesn't put enough power on it and fans
on it and just like that she gets
dispossessed Sarah Nellis cross ice to
Newton and Newton and has one heck of a
slap shot into the top right corner you
might be seeing that one on ESPN what a
beautiful shot Burke had absolutely no
chance of getting absolutely zero and
it's to nothing to score now in favor of
Mercyhurst 14 minutes to go in the third
period Penn State needs one and they
need it fast Mercyhurst in the offensive
zone though as Penn State will take it
and try and make something of their own
could the goal bring life into a Nittany
Lion team that has been pretty laxa days
ago so far Madsen down the nearest down
the near boards dumps it around the ice
around the edge and Mercyhurst will win
it back
and they lose it off of an errant pass
in the middle of the zone Penn State
will dump it yet again into the Mersey
her zone this time they win the race
Penn State in the near corner as they
lose it and Mercyhurst will tack down
the near side and they'll lose it yet
again plenty of back and forth hockey
right now
yes Mercyhurst doesn't get much of
anything there either back and forth in
the middle of the zone no one can keep
possession and this time and state's
defense another errant pass gets enough
to rank in Penn State's first line on
they can't make passes with each other
either into the Mercyhurst zone it goes
behind the net and they'll try and take
it out themselves it's a battle of who
can get it into the other zone and keep
it in there for more than five seconds
at this point McMillan behind the net of
Penn State pass it out to Rankin
Rankin's got a chance now on her own
she's the only one looking for help and
she'll wheel and deal backhand chance
great defense right there by Rachel
Marmot and Mercyhurst will win
possession and that puck will scurry
into the bleachers by us and we will get
a faceoff 12:35 to go in the third
period as members of the roar zone will
now run out and try and collect that
puck no one on this side of course
running over to see if he can grab that
puck Penn State wins the offensive
faceoff and it'll actually go beyond the
blue line and off to reset Ganga Rosa on
the puck in the defensive zone pass it
up to high sink high Singh facing some
tough defense and are off in her
defensive zone icing on the puck again
and she's not able to receive that pass
and Mercyhurst will get a chance of her
own to reset Nellis on the near boards
is being fought with another Penn State
player plenty of them around there as
Newton could have a chance here and she
was with dump it behind Chantel Burks
net Penn State trying to reset Ganga
Rosa down the right side to Weiss Weiss
cross-ice to rank it that's actually
Natalie high Singh still on the ice long
shift for her and Mercyhurst will dump a
lot of dump and chase going on right now
1140 to go in the third period to
nothing to score that could have been
too many players in the ice right there
for Penn State no hand signal from the
referee as Mercyhurst is battling and
dumps it into the offensive zone and
into the hands of the Penn State defense
yet again another dump will go to the
Mercyhurst defense and back to the Penn
State defense it's almost a cycle at
this point just back and forth they go
back and forth and go it's just like you
want the puck no you want the bug you I
take the puck no you take the puck
there's no sort of possession and
Mercyhurst their two goals I've just
been mistakes by the Penn State defense
not much sustained possession in this
game Penn State could have a chance on
offense now as it's Brooke Madsen
passing it behind the net to Shane
Nelson and just like that Mercyhurst
wins possession and they can clear their
lines out in the middle of the ice Penn
State wins it and they'll try and dump
it back into the offensive zone but
that's not gonna happen through not ten
Mercyhurst has a chance shot blocked in
front of the net that shot was by Emily
Pinto she was the only one against Penn
State three defenders Penn State now
behind their own net trying to reset
their attacking they're attacking
forwards are coming very close in to
their defense as all of their long
passes seem to get picked off as right
there we see a shot by Rey by rayo and
thrown into the into the glove of
Chantel Burke
