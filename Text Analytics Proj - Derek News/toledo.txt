Derek Hyde NBC 24 news max Morrissey had
just opened this pizza and ice cream
shop behind me to a crowd of people in
May of 2022. I've never seen him so
excited the day we opened
thank you a few months later tragedy
struck when both Max and his brother Ben
were killed in last year's BP Husky
Refinery fire just you know 
the store has been closed since that day
and Max's wife Dara didn't know if she
would ever reopen it again it's
obviously
Thursday the store
reopened its doors and served its first
ice cream of the year a small cone to
Max's three-year-old son wrecker hey
thank you
this weekend is just a soft opening for
the restaurant with a limited menu but
the Oregon Community was there to help
the family yet again One customer called
the restaurant 45 minutes early to buy
the first 10 customers orders just
the restaurant will also be selling
these shirts that I have on throughout
the week urging people to live life to

this group is a month and a half into
their walk from Minneapolis into
Washington D.C Monday they walked
through Toledo lyanna right as you say
that there's one flying immediately over
my head because the residents of Swanton
have gotten used to that sound of f-16s
except now they get to hear this during
the day and the night this apartment
complex off of Oak Street in Weston was
left completely destroyed this morning
and Juliana I'm live right now inside of
Waterville Elementary where that vote
will take place very soon except there's
one thing from everyone I've talked to
around Waterville it doesn't seem like
too many people actually want that to
happen that's right Juliana the 50th
annual Greek festival is here and I'm
now joined by Monty from the church
Monty I'm being told you brought a
special dish for us to try here it was in
this parking lot behind me that those
two men allowed a bowsher student to
take pictures with the weapons on their
school's homecoming night that's right
Jeep Fest is finally here in the events
are starting right here in downtown
Toledo on Saturday afternoon White House
PD had only brought in 10 toy donations
so instead they cut a deal that brought
hundreds more instead I definitely have
officer Addison White made a deal with the
community 10 push-ups for every toy
donated over the weekend
it worked it worked a little
too well I guess you would say
in 36 hours the local area donated
578 toys worth
5780 push-ups
the police department posted to Facebook
expecting an extra 10 toys but instead
their post went viral and
we're like oh wow officer white just
started at the department two weeks ago
and now has his work cut out for him 
to chip away at 100 hundred of them and
the PD said that they're going to help
me out and with core values like these
they won't be skipping any push-ups so
all right Officer white
I will donate those 20 push-ups to you
and your cause so by my account you've
probably got about 5 500 more to go in
White House Derek Hyde NBC 24 news
hey guys that's right so many kids in
this area are trick-or-treating behind
me and they've had a really jam-packed
day full of costumes candy and falling
pumpkins
Ottawa Hills Elementary principal Jeremy
Bauer held a pumpkin decorating
competition for his students 
each class got a pumpkin and the best
decorated got a pizza party uh just for
some laughs and just a little break you
know and then
all 30 pumpkins were thrown from the
roof of the building I think people were
first like is he really going to smash
these pumpkins 
Pumpkin Smash was a fun Halloween
activity for the kids to finish their
school day with but it had a deeper
meaning
that's big because tonight's Halloween
so we have all the kids parents and even
the marching band joined in for the fun
and for the trick-or-treat safety tips
for Monday night
and so now that all of the pumpkins have
been reduced to much trick-or-treaters
will be out not just in Ottawa Hills but
in a lot of areas around us until around
8 PM live in Ottawa Hills Derek Hyde NBC

and with just days before Saturday's big
game one store in Maumee is completely
split down the middle one half Ohio
State and one half Michigan so whether
or not you make all your shots
or you put them that far along like me
odds are your local golf course has seen
it all this summer a Toledo Speedway
will host 24 cars a lot more powerful
than this one and the Arca Menard Series
championship air tomorrow both Whitmer
and Clay will together have a joint
orange out at the game to promote gun
safety I did get the chance to talk to
Toledo police earlier today and they
told me there were no updates on this
case so if you want your chance to see
some of these massive RC cars you have
until Sunday to come down to the Wood
County Fairgrounds the Monroe County
Fair might seem like every other local
fair going on this summer with french
fries and peanuts right behind me but if
I turn the camera around right now
you're gonna see something that you
don't see at every local fair the world
famous flying will lenders are
performing
Gabrielle Grigsby is just like every
other 17 year old she's off from school
hangs out with her friends and was
excited to get her driver's license at
16
this is her race car it's that she races
at
in the state of Ohio you
can get your driver's license at 16. but
imagine racing a half mile track against
people double your age and winning all
before you turn 18. 
she's never had to race alone because
she grew up watching her dad who races
in the division above her
he got into racing from his late father
who passed his lucky number onto both of
them
together they make up Breezy racing
named after Gabrielle of course
the 17 year old girl is a fan favorite
at both tracks
well now that you know
who they are the only thing left to do
is come to Toledo Speedway and watch
them drive past on the weekend the Black
Swamp banshees are a different kind of
Club sport they don't play volleyball or
dodgeball at the this club plays
quidditch yes that is the sport from the
Harry Potter movies and books the game is
highly physical like rugby and involves
many Harry Potter accurate positions
like Seekers and beaters and yes the
broom must stay between your legs at all
times so you might be thinking wow
that's seems a little bit complicated
but really all you need to know is if
you throw this ball through any one of
these three Hoops you get 10 points oh
and how and the game is more
popular than you'd think
according to their website us quidditch
serves an average of 3 500 athletes and
150 teams each season Nationwide these
banshees just hope to be the first in
Toledo so if this caught your
interest and you want to take your shot
at any of the three Hoops then you can
check out the Black Swamp banshees on
Facebook in Toledo Derek Hyde NBC 24
